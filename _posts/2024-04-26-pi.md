## Intro

The goal of this post is to show my Pi setup. I use a Raspberry 4 4GB mainly as a self-hosted server with Nextcloud to replace Google Drive. 

```
This setup does not need access to a router, in theory. The worst part of a Pi setup is not managing to ssh into it. 
So, if its possible to access the router admin panel and look the Pi ip everything will be smooth.
```

The first thing to do is to install the OS image in the SSD (documentation [**here**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#install-using-imager){:target="_blank"}).
My goal is to have a headless setup, meaning I can only access through ssh. I prefer to use OS Lite bulleye, since it allows to configure the wifi connection via the wpa_supplicant.conf file in boot folder.
Dont forget to enable ssh. If its not enabled you can add a empty file named ssh in the SSD boot folder.

## Wifi connection

The pi imager asks for the wifi settings, so this step is not necessary.
But I like to configure the Pi to be able to connect to multiple Wifi, just in case.
On the SSD, inside the boot folder, create a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wpa_supplicant.conf</code> with your Wifi config as in

```conf
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=BR

# home wifi
network={
  ssid="wifi"
  psk=""
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

# eduroam
network={
	ssid="eduroam"
	key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
	eap=PEAP
	phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
	identity="username@ufrgs.br"
	password=""
}
```
  
## Pi config

With that the Pi is ready to boot, so connect the SSD on the Pi and try to ssh into it.
If you are in the same network from the Pi you should be able to ssh using the hostname set in the OS installation. 

If you are using WSL on windows and cannot use hostname only inside WSL, you need to change (or create if doesnt exists) .wslconfig and write

```
dnsTunneling=false
``` 

located in the %UserProfile% directory on Windows, which can be accessed by typing %UserProfile% in the Windows File Explorer address bar.

## Docker Compose

For the services on Pi we will install docker compose (see documentantion [**here**](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/){:target="_blank"}) using the debian setup.

Now just create a folder and a docker compose file and thats it. We just have to modify the compose file to what we need.

```
mkdir containers
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Docker Compose file

# run these
# docker compose pull && docker compose up -d

## Services

### ZeroTier

To have a private network between my devices Im using Zerotier.
To have access to the Pi services we have to install it in all devices that we want to grant access (see documentantion [**here**](https://docs.zerotier.com/start){:target="_blank"}).

if using wsl on windows, install zerotier on wsl terminal
```
curl -s https://install.zerotier.com | sudo bash
sudo zerotier-cli join 9ecbaef5759219ad
```

Inside the ZeroTier website we have to create a network and then connect all devices to it.
The good thing about ZeroTier is that we can set static Ip's for all devices.
Once the device is connected it must be approved in zerotier website.


		
			

### Nextcloud

Nextcloud is the Google drive replacement, where I store all my data.
The web interface for Nextcloud is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> http://ip:8080/apps/files/files </code> where the ip, in my case, is the zerotier ip that I set or the hostname.

The line in the docker compose file that changes where the data is stored is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">- /home/flores/nextcloud_data:/var/www/html</code>.
      

Some usefull commands for Nextcloud:


```
sudo rsync -avP /home/user/nextcloud_data/data/user/files/ /path/nextcloud_backup 
sudo rsync -chavzP --rsync-path="sudo rsync" --stats user@ip:/path/nextcloud_backup/ /path/nextcloud_backup
```

to backup inside pi and to backup to another machine, respectively. 

To send files from your machine to the server you can use

```
sudo rsync -chavzP --rsync-path="sudo rsync" --stats /path/nextcloud_backup/ user@ip:/home/user/nextcloud_data/data/lucasflores/files/
docker exec -u www-data nextcloud php /var/www/html/occ files:scan --all
```

The last command makes Nextcloud scan for new files. Running that command is needed for the new files to appear in the web interface. 





I need to thank Saumil Shah for the introduction to Raspberry Pi and its wonders. If not for him, this post would not be possible.
